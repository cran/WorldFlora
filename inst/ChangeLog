	Note that a static copy of the Taxonomic Backbone data can be downloaded from:
	<http://www.worldfloraonline.org/downloadData>. This can be done with function
	WFO.download(). If the function fails to download the entire, manually download the zip
	file and then use WFO.remember().

Version 1.13-2 (May 2023)

  * Modified function WFO.download() to change the default location of the taxonomic
  backbone data set to its new URL:
  https://files.worldfloraonline.org/files/WFO_Backbone/
  _WFOCompleteBackbone/WFO_Backbone.zip
  

Version 1.13 (March 2023)

  * A new function WFO.acceptable.match() that checks whether fuzzy matches could be a
  result from differences in gender between submitted names and names in the taxonomic
  backbone.

  * Corrected an error in WFO.match() to correctly handle Fuzzy <= 0 to skip fuzzy
  matching. (Corrected after the error was reported by Karina Banda.)

  * Modified function WFO.download() to work with new format of the World Flora Online
  backbone data file of 'classification.csv'. A timeout argument was added also.
  
  * Modified function WFO.download() to explicitly use the argument 'save.dir'.
  (Suggested by Nicolas Casajus, 24-MAR-2023).

  * Included a link to an application of WFO.match.fuzzyjoin() with a large data set from
  GlobalTreeSearch, especially to show how large data sets can be handled.
  <https://rpubs.com/Roeland-KINDT/996500>


Version 1.12 (January 2023)

  * A new function WFO.match.fuzzyjoin() was added that internally uses function
  fuzzyjoin::stringdist_left_join(). For some data sets, this results in significant
  improvement in speeds, particularly where a relative large number of records remain
  that could not be directly matched. In addition, the new function allows for alternative
  methods of calculating the fuzzy distance (via the internal fuzzyjoin function).

  * Modified function WFO.match() to first use a subset of the WFO.data. Also direct
  matching is now first done internally via dplyr::left_join(). These changes resulted
  in some improvements in execution speeds, especially where many taxa could be directly
  matched.

  * Internally WFO.match() converts spec.data data.tables to the data.frame format.

  * Corrected a new error in WFO.one() when no matches were found.


Version 1.11 (September 2022)

	* Made necessary corrections when checking package before uploading

	* Changed author email from previous CGIAR.org domain (as a new CIFOR-ICRAF domain
	will be created)


Version 1.10 (December 2021)

	* Modified functions WFO.one and WFO.browse to deal with capitalized taxonomic ranks
	of the DEC 2021 version of the taxonomic backbone.

	* Expanded the options for argument 'infraspecific.excluded' for WFO.match to include
	the new levels available from the DEC 2021 version of the taxonomic backbone.


Verson 1.9 (September 2021)

	* Variables of 'created' and 'modified' are deleted from the WFO.data in function
	WFO.match. Implemented based on a communication from Pavel Pipek (August 2021) that
	processing of these variables did significantly slow down the function.

	* Changed processing of the IDs in function WFO.one to be compatible with alternative
	taxonomic backbone data, especially when choosing between different options based on
	the smallest ID.

	* Yet another alternative example than shown in the documentation of using the
	new.backbone function to standardize plant species names with the World Checklist of
	Vascular Plants (https://wcvp.science.kew.org/) is provided in the following RPub:

	Kindt, R. 2021. Standardizing GlobalTreeSearch tree species names with World Flora
	Online and the World Checklist of Vascular Plants.
	https://rpubs.com/Roeland-KINDT


Verson 1.8 (August 2021)

	* New function new.backbone that allows to standardize names with a user-created
	taxonomic backbone data set.

	* An alternative example than shown in the documentation of using the
	new.backbone function to standardize mammal species names with the Mammal Diversity
	Database (https://www.mammaldiversity.org) is provided in the following RPub:

	Kindt, R. 2021. Standardizing mammal species names with the Mammal Species Database
	via exact and fuzzy matching functions from the WorldFlora package.
	https://rpubs.com/Roeland-KINDT


Verson 1.7 (September 2020)

	* Included reference to the article published in Applications in Plant Sciences

	* Forced fields of WFO.data$created and WFO.data$modified to be of the 'date' format.
	Where WFO.data had an empty date field, the date of 1000-01-01 was inserted. Where
	there were no matches, the date of 1000-01-02 was inserted. A problem had been
	reported by Lauri Vesa (10-Sep-2020)


Version 1.6 (7 May 2020)

	* New function WFO.download that downloads the Taxonomic Backbone data from the
	website (<http://www.worldfloraonline.org/downloadData>) and unzips the file in the
	working directory.

	* New function WFO.remember that remembers the location where the Taxonomic Backbone
	data were saved and reads in the data, default as 'WFO.data'

	* Function WFO.match now recognizes alternative family names (Compositae,
	Leguminosae, Umbelliferae, Palmae, Cruciferae, Guttiferae, Labiatae and Gramineae).

	* New argument 'squish' of WFO.match that removes white space from start and end of
	the submitted plant name and flags its earlier presence. Repeated whitespace inside
	the plant name is also removed. Feature was suggested by an external reviewer of the
	submitted article.

	* New arguments 'spec.name.sub' and 'sub.pattern' of WFO.prepare that aim to remove
	semi-standardized qualifiers in plant names such as 'aff.' and 'cf.'

	* New argument 'spec.name.nonumber' of WFO.prepare that results in only retaining the
	first word if there are numbers in the submitted plant name.

	* New argument 'genus.2.flag' of WFO.prepare that results in flagging submitted
	plant names where the first word only has 2 characters (this function is intended
	to flag qualifiers in plant names that were wrongly interpreted as genus names).

	* New argument 'species.2.flag' of WFO.prepare that results in flagging submitted
	plant names where the second word only has 2 characters (this function is intended
	to flag qualifiers in plant names that were wrongly interpreted as species names).

	* New argument 'punctuation.flag' of WFO.prepare that results in flagging punctuation
	marks

	* New argument 'pointless.flag' of WFO.prepare that results in flagging parts of
	submitted plant names that flags if there is a sub.pattern without the punctuation
	mark (for example, if the plant name included 'aff' which is sub.pattern 'aff.'
	without the punctuation mark).


Version 1.5 (28 March 2020)

	* New argument 'First.dist' of WFO.match and WFO.one results in calculating the
	Levenshtein distance between the first word of the submitted and matched plant names.
	Typically this applies to the genus name. WFO.one will select the matches with the
	smallest 'First.dist'.

	* Modified the behaviour of WFO.match when matches were only found via Fuzzy.two. In
	these cases, only matches with 2 words are retained.

	* Avoided an error when no name is submitted to WFO.match.


Version 1.4 (20 February 2020)

	* New function WFO.prepare that attempts to split a list of plant names into the
	botanical name and the naming authority.

	* Corrected a bug in function WFO.match to fail when there were missing values in the
	acceptedNameUsageID (error reported by Sandeep Pulla).

	* Allowed function WFO.match to deal with situations where there were several sections
	between brackets in the plant name.

	* Included a reference to the preprint of Kindt R. 2020. WorldFlora: An R package for
	exact and fuzzy matching of plant names against the World Flora Online Taxonomic
	Backbone data. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.02.930719v1


Version 1.3 (1 February 2020)

	* New function WFO.browse that shows all taxa at a next hierarchical level from the
	submitted and matched plant name (submitting a family results in a list of genera,
	a genus in a list of species and a species in a list of records at infraspecific
	levels). If no taxon is submitted, the function returns a list of all families.

	* New function WFO.synonyms that gives all taxa that have the same acceptedNameUsageID
	as the submitted and matched plant name.

	* New data.set 'vascular.families' that gives information about orders and major clades
	documented by the fourth update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG IV,
	https://doi.org/10.1111/boj.12385). For gymnosperm and pteridophyte taxa, orders were
	obtained from <http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/>.

	* New function WFO.family that provides information from the 'vascular.families' for
	vascular families (angiosperms, gymnosperms and pteridophytes). For bryophytes, the
	function returns 'bryophytes' based on an internal list of bryophyte families.

	* Modified WFO.match to handle the problem where authorities are not available for all
	submitted taxa (this caused a problem in WFO.one to select a unique best match).


Version 1.2 (4 January 2020)

	* New function WFO.one that results in a one-to-one match between the submitted
	plant names and the matched plant names. Where there were various candidates for a
	match, users can specify whether accepted names or names that are not synonyms are
	given priority. Where multiple candidates still exist, the matched name with the
	smallest ID is selected.

	* Yet another priority is invoked for function WFO.one when the Authorship is given.
	In that case, first priority is given to records with the best match in Authorship.

	* The pattern ' x ' is now interpreted as marking of a hybrid plant name.

	* Sections in plant names that follow bracket '(' are now removed from the checked
	plant name, invoked by new argument 'Fuzzy.nobrackets' in WFO.match. This feature
	is expected to remove part of authorities that are not part of the names to be
	matched (a match is searched in WFO column of 'scientificName', not
	'scientificNameAuthorship').

	* New arguments of 'Fuzzy.two' and 'Fuzzy.one' in function WFO.match that limit names
	to be matched to respectively the first two or first terms of that name. These
	options are expected to eliminate parts of names that are authorities, which are not
	part of names to be matched (see also argument 'Fuzzy.nobrackets').

	* New argument 'Authorship' for the WFO.match function that allows the user to
	specify the Authorship. The function will calculate the Levenshtein distance between
	the submitted and matched Authorships.

	* With a too large number of fuzzy matches, the message now gives one of the matched
	plant names, allowing the user to potentially verify the correctedness of a genus
	name.

	* The behaviour of 'spec.name.nonumber' now changed to limits searches to the first
	term in case a submitted name contained any numbers (in the previous version, the
	behaviour was to searh for numbers at the end of submitted names).


Version 1.1 (15 December 2019)

	* New function WFO.url that creates urls for matched plant names, with an option to
	open a selection of urls in an HTML browser.

	* It is possible now to only match the Genus name.

	* New argument 'Fuzzy.force' to always use Fuzzy matching, even when an exact match
	was found for the spec.name.

	* New argument 'Fuzzy.max' to limit the number of fuzzy matches.

	* New argument 'Fuzzy.min' to limit the fuzzy matches to those with the smallest
	Levenshtein distance.

	* Output from function WFO.match gives the Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matches.

	* New argument spec.name.tolower that changes submitted species names to lower case
	characters, except the first character

	* New argument 'spec.name.nonumber' that interpretes submitted names as unidentified
	species and seeks matches at generic level

	* New argument 'exclude.infraspecific' that removes matched records with the specified
	infraspecific levels. Note that these matched records are removed both from matched
	plant names (including synonyms) and matched accepted plant names (excluding
	synonyms)

	* New argument spec.name.sub that removes sections in the submitted plant name


Version 1.0 (December 2019)

	* Package developed and submitted to CRAN
